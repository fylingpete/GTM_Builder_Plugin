# Chief Charlie Cowork Plugin

A Claude Cowork (and Claude Code) plugin that turns Claude into **Chief Charlie**, a Founder Operating System.

Chief Charlie guides a founder through the right phase of their company — **PMF**, **GTM**, or **Scale** — using a single source of truth (`dashboard_data.json`), structured cadences (weekly check-ins, monthly reviews, quarterly rebuilds), append-only decision logging, and curated knowledge from Skok, Hormozi, YC, and Wickman (EOS™).

## What's inside

This repository is a **marketplace** containing one plugin:

```

```

## Install

### From Claude Cowork (Desktop App)

1. Open Claude Cowork → click **Customize** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Add plugin** → select **GitHub**
3. Enter: `fylingpete/Chief_Charlie_Cowork_Plugin`
4. Install the `chief-charlie-v2` plugin

### From Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add fylingpete/Chief_Charlie_Cowork_Plugin
/plugin install chief-charlie-v2@chief-charlie
/reload-plugins
```

### Updating

Claude Cowork / Claude Code caches the marketplace listing and does NOT auto-refresh — when a new version ships, the in-app "Update" button stays greyed until the cache is invalidated.

To pull the latest version:

```bash
/plugin marketplace update chief-charlie   # forces a fresh fetch from GitHub
/plugin update chief-charlie-v2@chief-charlie
/reload-plugins
```

If the CLI commands aren't exposed in Cowork's UI, remove and re-add the marketplace via the "Add marketplace" dialog — same effect.

## First run

After installing, **create a dedicated folder for your Chief Charlie work** and open Claude Cowork / Claude Code in that folder:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ChiefCharlie
cd ~/ChiefCharlie
# then open Claude Cowork in this folder (or `claude` from CLI)
```

Then run:

```
/onboarding
```

The onboarding command will:
1. Verify you're in a dedicated folder (and tell you how to create one if not)
2. Walk you through 8 founder identity questions (German by default)
3. Show your first roadmap after question 4 ("wow moment")
4. Initialize `.founder-os/dashboard_data.json` and supporting state files
5. Drop you into the right path (PMF / GTM / Scale) at the right phase

After onboarding, every session greets you with your current phase, bottleneck, and any overdue cadence — pulled live by the SessionStart hook.

## Daily use

- `/founder-os` — open the OS, see current phase + next actions
- `/weekly-checkin` — weekly KPI review + decision log
- `/monthly-review` — monthly path milestone review (GTM + Scale)
- `/quarterly-rebuild` — quarterly strategic rebuild
- `/log-decision` — append a decision to the log
- `/log-learning` — append a learning to the log

### Account (optional)

- `/account` — show current account info (triggers a browser login the first time)
- `/logout` — instructions to disconnect via Cowork settings

See "Connect to your Chief Charlie account" below for details.

The `founder-os` skill auto-fires whenever you discuss founder work — you don't have to invoke it explicitly. The `decision-logging` skill watches every conversation for decisions/learnings and appends them automatically.

## Subagents

- `research` — focused research with web search + sources
- `market-report` — full market reports written to `research/`

## What this plugin does NOT do (yet)

Compared to the full Chief Charlie (desktop app + LangGraph backend), the plugin form factor has some honest limits:

| Feature | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Vector / semantic memory search | ⚠️ Replaced with grep | Plugins can't run embedding pipelines |
| Multi-device sync | ❌ Not built in | Use git or iCloud/Dropbox on the folder |
| WhatsApp + Voice channels | ❌ Out of scope | Cowork is desktop only |
| Activity heatmap + usage dashboard | ❌ Dropped | No backend to count messages |
| Auto-managed reminders + cron | ⚠️ Use native | Claude Cowork has native scheduled tasks |

## Connect to your Chief Charlie account

When you call an account-aware tool (`/account`) for the first time, Cowork will open a browser tab where you can log in at chiefcharlie.ai (Supabase auth — email/password, magic link, or social providers). Cowork stores the OAuth token internally; subsequent calls reuse it transparently.

No manual token-paste, env-vars, or local config files required.

If you already have a Chief Charlie account (web/desktop), the plugin will connect to the same account.

To disconnect: Cowork Settings → MCP Servers → "chief-charlie" → Disconnect.

### Backend URL

The plugin connects to `https://api.chiefcharlie.ai/mcp` by default. To test against a dev backend, you can edit `.mcp.json` in the plugin source.

## Add connectors (MCPs)

`chief-charlie-v2/.mcp.json` starts empty. Add MCP servers there to give Charlie access to your tools (Notion, Linear, Slack, HubSpot, Gmail, ...). For Cowork-compatible MCPs, the server must be reachable over the public internet OR run locally on the user's machine.

Examples to add later:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion": { "url": "https://your-notion-mcp.example.com/sse" },
    "linear": { "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/sse" }
  }
}
```
