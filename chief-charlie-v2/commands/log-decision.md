# /log-decision

Append a decision entry to the append-only decision log.

1. Get the decision content. If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the seed. If not, ask the user:

   > **Was hast du entschieden, und warum?**

2. Probe for missing fields — ask one focused follow-up if any are unclear:
   - **decision** — what was decided (1 sentence)
   - **reasoning** — why this option over alternatives (1–2 sentences)
   - **reverse_if** — what would cause you to reverse this decision (1 sentence)

3. Read `.founder-os/dashboard_data.json` → `current_path` to fill the `path` field.

4. Construct the JSON line:

```json
{"type":"decision","date":"YYYY-MM-DD","path":"pmf|gtm|scale","decision":"...","reasoning":"...","reverse_if":"..."}
```

5. Append (do NOT overwrite) to `.founder-os/decisions_learnings.jsonl`:

```bash
echo '{"type":"decision","date":"...","path":"...","decision":"...","reasoning":"...","reverse_if":"..."}' >> .founder-os/decisions_learnings.jsonl
```

6. **Dual-write to mem0 (long-term memory).** If the `chief-charlie` MCP tools are available this session (load via ToolSearch if not yet loaded — see `CLAUDE.md` → "Long-term memory"), call:

   ```
   add_memory(
     content="Decision ({path}, {date}): {decision}. Reasoning: {reasoning}. Reverse if: {reverse_if}.",
     category="decision"
   )
   ```

   If the tools are unavailable (user not logged in via MCP), skip silently — the local JSONL is still the source of truth.

7. Confirm to the user:

   > Logged. Decision-Counter dieses Quartal: {count}. Soll ich dir den Eintrag nochmal vorlesen?

8. **Important:** This is an append-only log. Never read it and rewrite the whole file. Only append new lines.
