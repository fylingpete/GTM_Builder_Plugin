# Chief Charlie SessionStart hook

# Emits a single instruction telling the assistant to load the Founder OS
# state from 01_command_center/dashboards/dashboard_data.json in the user's
# selected workspace folder. We do not try to locate the file from this hook,
# because in Cowork there is no reliable env var that points at the
# user-selected workspace — $PWD is the temporary outputs scratchpad, not the
# workspace. Delegating to the assistant (which has scoped file access to the
# selected workspace) works in both Claude Code and Cowork.
